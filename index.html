						<p>Hello, welcome to my personal website! This is the site I use to showcase all of my personal interests such as music, modding and other things I do such as my Youtube Channel and development. I also showcase some of my personal projects on here. I'm using Neocities as other people I knew (LegitSi) had it in their bio, I have always wanted my own site (and my own forum) and have used some webpage hosting sites before.</p>
						<p>This site basically serves as a hub for all things GreenieGuest. Have fun exploring around!</p>
						<p>Don't expect the Holy Grail of websites, I'm still somewhat new to HTML. (If it ain't broke, don't fix it.)</p>
