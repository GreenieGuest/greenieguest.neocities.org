			<div class="infobox">
				<p> I'm a CS undergrad who has liked the idea of creating my own stuff since the age of 3 but isn't very good at it. I don't play games that often anymore, I mostly listen to music, make a simulation or otherwise bide my time unwisely.</p>
				<p> My main claim to fame is the YouTube channel I have that randomly blew up one day in 2016. I consider myself an 'Algotuber' though I don't make the same kind of content that most others in my genre make.</p>

						<h1>Music</h1>
						<p>Music is the best escape from the troubles of the world. Most of my music taste is inherited from the indie game series "Emily is Away" hence my heavily 90's-and-2000's music taste. (Also sarah. Thanks Sarah!)</p>
						<p>My favorite artists in order are:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Abandoned Pools</li>
							<li>Senses Fail</li>
							<li>Dashboard Confessional</li>
							<li>Snow Patrol</li>
							<li>Alanis Morissette</li>

					<h1>Other Interests & Fun Facts</h1>
					<p>I'm very notoriously uncultured but I do still have some supplements of culture in me. (I also have a very clear liking for time travel which reflects in my taste, and I would abuse it if it were real)</p>
					<h4>Favorite Movies:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Groundhog Day</li>
						<li>Back to the Future 1-3</li>
						<li>Titanic</li>
						<li>Terminator 1 and 2 (the good ones)</li>
						<li>Superbad</li>
						<li>Eurotrip</li>
					</ol>
					(honorable mentions: 21/22 Jump Street, How to Train Your Dragon, Breakfast Club, Deadpool and Wolverine)
					<h4>Favorite TV Shows:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Survivor</li>
						<li>Game of Thrones (Everything after Season 4 isn't real)</li>
						<li>Breaking Bad</li>
						<li>The Walking Dead</li>
						<li>The Office</li>
						<li>CSI: Miami</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Favorite Games:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Europa Universalis IV</li>
						<li>The Sims 4</li>
						<li>Emily Is Away Too</li>
						<li>Stardew Valley</li>
						<li>Cities Skylines</li>
					</ol>
					Other things I enjoy doing are writing down dreams, journaling and occasionally writing a giant script for a series that never ends up being made. I'm a big memorykeeping person.
					<h1>More Music Lists</h1>
					<h4>Favorite Songs:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Abandoned Pools - Blood</li>
						<li>Abandoned Pools - The Remedy</li>
						<li>Snow Patrol - Spitting Games</li>
						<li>The Killers - Mr. Brightside</li>
						<li>Gwen Stefani - The Sweet Escape</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Favorite Albums:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Abandoned Pools - Humanistic (Still one of my favorite albums, it should have gotten more love. Thanks Sarah)</li>
						<li>Dashboard Confessional - The Swiss Army Romance (I have a love for acoustic songs. Ender Will Save Us All is one of my favorites)</li>
						<li>Dashboard Confessional - The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most (Early era Dashboard is peak.)</li>
						<li>Senses Fail - Let It Enfold You (Thanks Emily Is Away Too for this one. Martini Kiss is perfect for a drive home)</li>
						<li>Alanis Morissette - Jagged Little Pill (Described my 2023 summer. One of the few 'perfect albums' in my opinion)</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Favorite Survivor Seasons:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>S28 - Cagayan (Probably the most peak newbie season Survivor will ever have. Also the season that got me into Survivor in the first place.)</li>
						<li>S20 - Heroes vs. Villains (Absolute cinema. 'Nuff said)</li>
						<li>S37 - David vs. Goliath (Definitely the best season of the post-Cagayan era. The cast is just too good, and Natalie should have lasted longer)</li>
						<li>AUS - Australia vs. The World (Probably my most hyped-for season. Awesome to see peak Parvati & Cirie again, and I loved Tony, Kass and George)</li>
						<li>S33 - Millennials vs. Gen X (I heard this season was good but I wasn't expecting it to be THAT good.)</li>
						<li>S40 - Winners at War (Horrific boot order, but for what it's worth, it was still a great season even with some of the twists)</li>
